# PANDORA-BOX
#### A Collection of Cute But Deadly Viruses in a box

**They will instantly snatch control from you. Then will sicken your high-end PC by overflowing the RAM & overwhelming the processor. And you will see your computer groaning till it crashes. Believe me, viruses were never so lovely before.**

Computer is a very complex machine. You just have to break one support to crash the whole structure. It can be done in many ways- overloading the processor, overflowing the RAM, flooding the hard-disk, occupying input/output system or any other resource, and erasing essential software (like- operating system). Follow the [Disaster Level](#disaster-level) for getting a categorical view of the project.

[browser_breaker.html](https://github.com/Sanix-Darker/PANDORA-BOX/browser_breaker.html) | The site contains JS code which generates an infinite string of characters that overwhelms the memory. 
[cmd_blast.c](https://github.com/Sanix-Darker/PANDORA-BOX/cmd_blast.c) | Opens an infinite number of command prompt window till the system crushes.
[unclosable.html](https://github.com/Sanix-Darker/PANDORA-BOX/unclosable.html) | Opens lots of windows in the browser and crushes the PC.
[consecutive_normal_punch.c](https://github.com/Sanix-Darker/PANDORA-BOX/consecutive_normal_punch.c) | A fork-bomb that creates lots of child process till the computer gives up.
[fork_bomb.sh](https://github.com/Sanix-Darker/PANDORA-BOX/fork_bomb.sh) | Creates an infinite number of processes.
[ram_slayer.c](https://github.com/Sanix-Darker/PANDORA-BOX/ram_slayer.c) | Consumes full space of the RAM.

### Level-3: Demon
Code | Intro
--- | --- 
[cpu_eater.bat](https://github.com/Sanix-Darker/PANDORA-BOX/cpu_eater.bat) | This batch program recursively executes itself forever and takes up full CPU usage.
[zip_bomb_42.zip](https://github.com/Sanix-Darker/PANDORA-BOX/zip_bomb_42.zip) | 4.5 petabytes of data compressed into 42 kilobytes. Trying to uncompress may prove fatal.
[folder_flooder.bat](https://github.com/Sanix-Darker/PANDORA-BOX/folder_flooder.bat) | Creates a lot of folders on the disk.


**Note**: I have personally tested all of the programs on my laptop; no permanent damage was caused by any of them. But I cannot guarantee your safety. So **run them on your own risk**. 

You can stop them by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+Del* or kill the process with task manager. For testing, you may also use online compilers, like- [TutorialsPoint-CodingGround](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm) or [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages).
